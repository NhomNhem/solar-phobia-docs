## Current State

**Current Stage**: Production
**Target Stage**: Polish

---

## Required Artifacts: 3/5 present

- [x] Active code in subsystems — `Assets/_Project/` has Domain/Application/Infrastructure/Presentation structure (~90+ C# files)
- [x] Core mechanics implemented — 16 GDDs approved (15 MVP + 1 Vertical Slice)
- [?] End-to-end playable — NOT VERIFIED (smoke test confirms new game starts, full loop untested)
- [x] Test files exist — 29 test files in `Assets/_Project/**/Tests/Editor/`
- [?] Playtest report — NO FORMAL REPORT (smoke test evidence exists)

---

## Quality Checks: 1/4 passing

- [x] Tests passing — PASS (82 tests, 81 passing, 1 pre-existing unrelated failure)
- [?] No critical bugs — MANUAL CHECK NEEDED (no bug tracker, no playtest data)
- [?] Core loop plays — MANUAL CHECK NEEDED (no formal playtest)
- [x] Performance — UNKNOWN (technical-preferences.md missing)

---

## Blockers

1. **Missing technical-preferences.md** — Performance budgets not defined
2. **No formal playtest report** — Cannot verify core loop plays as designed
3. **End-to-end verification missing** — Full day→choice→night loop not confirmed

---

## Non-Blocking

- 5 GDD systems still "Not Started" (Vertical Slice/Alpha priority, not MVP)
- Epic stories actively in progress

---

## Verdict: CONCERNS

Core infrastructure is solid (tests passing, code organized, GDDs approved), but unverifiable items need attention before advancing to Polish.

---

### Recommended Next Steps

1. Create `docs/technical-preferences.md` with performance budgets
2. Run `/playtest-report` to generate formal playtest evidence
3. Verify full day→night gameplay loop manually
