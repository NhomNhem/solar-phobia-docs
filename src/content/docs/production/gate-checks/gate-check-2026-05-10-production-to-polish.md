## Gate Check: Production → Polish

**Date**: 2026-05-10  
**Checked by**: gate-check skill

### Required Artifacts: 2/5 present
- [ ] `src/` has active code organized into subsystems — **MISSING/INSUFFICIENT** (`src/` contains only `.gitkeep` and `CLAUDE.md`)
- [ ] All core mechanics from GDD are implemented (cross-reference `design/gdd/` with `src/`) — **FAILED** (no implementation code in `src/`)
- [?] Main gameplay path is playable end-to-end — **MANUAL CHECK NEEDED**
- [ ] Test files exist in `tests/` — **MISSING** (`tests/` directory not found)
- [x] At least 1 playtest report — present: `production/playtest-reports/playtest-2026-05-09-initial.md`

### Quality Checks: 0/4 passing (1 partial evidence, 3 not verified)
- [ ] Tests are passing — **NOT VERIFIED / FAILED TO RUN HERE** (`Unity.exe` not available in PATH in this environment)
- [?] No critical/blocker bugs — **MANUAL CHECK NEEDED** (no canonical bug register found)
- [?] Core loop plays as designed vs GDD acceptance — **MANUAL CHECK NEEDED**
- [ ] Performance within budget (`technical-preferences.md`) — **FAILED/NOT EVIDENCED** (`TODO` items still open; `tests/performance` missing)

### Blockers
1. **No active implementation under `src/`** for Production→Polish gate criteria.
2. **No `tests/` directory** as required by this gate definition.
3. **Automated test pass not verifiable** in current environment (`Unity.exe` unavailable).
4. **Performance evidence absent** (`tests/performance` missing, technical preferences still draft/TODO).

### Recommendations
- Align gate criteria with actual code location (`Assets/_Project`) or mirror production code into `src/` if `src/` is mandated.
- Add/standardize a `tests/` root (or update gate policy to Unity test locations under `Assets/_Project/**/Editor/Tests`).
- Run Unity EditMode + PlayMode tests on a machine with Unity CLI available and attach reports.
- Produce one performance profiling artifact (`/perf-profile`) and close TODOs in technical preferences.

### Verdict: FAIL
- Critical blockers must be resolved before advancing to **Polish**.
