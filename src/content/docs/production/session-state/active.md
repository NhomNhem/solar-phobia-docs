- Story: production/epics/phase-state-machine/story-007-ngoc-cot-relic-pickups.md — Ngọc Cốt Relic Pickups — Ward Drain Multiplier
- Files changed:
  - Assets/_Project/Domain/Services/INgocCotService.cs (new interface)
  - Assets/_Project/Application/Services/NgocCotService.cs (new service implementation)
  - Assets/_Project/Infrastructure/Services/WardTimerService.cs (updated formula to multiplicative)
