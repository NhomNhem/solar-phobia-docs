## Overview

Curse Effect Modules control the karma-based hazards that spawn during Night Phase based on which soul was abandoned during Day Phase. Each curse (Drag/Block/FakeShrine) manifests as specific environmental hazards with unique visual and audio signatures.

**Theme**: "Haunted specificity" — Not generic danger, but *this particular* horror because of *this particular* choice. The water trap feels like Linh's drowning. The blood net feels like Van's capture. The illusion platform feels like Minh's betrayal. The horror is personal and deserved.
