## Context

**GDD**: Master GDD V5.0 — Section 3.1
**ADR**: ADR-0003-v2

Swing: Left Click near anchor point → grapple arc movement, costs -2.0s Ward.
Glide: Hold (airborne) → slow fall + horizontal drift, costs -1.0s/sec Ward.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Left Click near anchor: Swing activates, costs -2.0s Ward on attach.
- [x] Glide: holding while airborne reduces gravity scale, costs -1.0s/sec Ward.
- [x] Both skills blocked when PlayerInputMode != NightMovement.
- [x] Swing blocked when Ward <= 2.0s.
- [x] Glide auto-cancels when Ward reaches 0.
