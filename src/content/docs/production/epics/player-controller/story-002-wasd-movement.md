title: 'Story 002: WASD Base Movement — CharacterController Night Traversal'
---

> **Epic**: player-controller
> **Superseded-by**: story-002-v2-ad-movement-2d.md
> **Reason**: Game is 2D side-scroller. WASD/3D movement replaced by A/D + Rigidbody2D.
> **Status**: Superseded (see story-002-v2-ad-movement-2d.md)
> **Layer**: Core
> **Type**: Logic
> **Priority**: P0
> **Estimate**: 6 hours
> **Manifest Version**: N/A

## Context

**GDD**: `design/gdd/player-controller.md`
**TR-ID**: `TR-player-002`
**ADR Governing Implementation**: ADR-0003: Player Controller Pattern
**ADR Decision Summary**: CharacterController.Move() with WASD input vector, gravity applied per frame. `base_move_speed` is a configurable tuning knob (default 5.0, range 2.0–8.0).

**Engine**: Unity 6000.3.11f1 (Unity 6) | **Risk**: HIGH

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] WASD keys drive horizontal movement relative to camera facing during `NightSurvival`.
- [x] `effective_speed = base_move_speed * 1.0` when not sprinting.
- [x] Gravity applied each frame: `moveVector.y = -9.81f * Time.deltaTime`.
- [x] Movement is ignored when `PlayerInputMode != NightMovement`.
- [x] `base_move_speed` is a configurable tuning knob — not hardcoded inline.

---

## Implementation Notes

*Derived from ADR-0003 Implementation Guidelines:*

- `CharacterController.Move(moveVector * speed * Time.deltaTime)`
- Input: `_inputActions.Player.Move.ReadValue<Vector2>()`
- `base_move_speed` default: 5.0, safe range 2.0–8.0 (per GDD Tuning Knobs)
- Processed in `Update()` only when `_currentMode == NightMovement`
- Movement vector: `new Vector3(moveInput.x, gravity, moveInput.y)`

---

## Out of Scope

*Handled by neighbouring stories — do not implement here:*

- Sprint multiplier (Story 003)
- Cover detection (Story 004)
- Stuck detection / teleport fallback (polish story, not in this epic)

## QA Test Cases

- **AC-1**: WASD moves player at base speed
  - Given: Phase = NightSurvival, `base_move_speed = 5.0`
  - When: Player holds W for 1 second
  - Then: Player position changes by ~5 units forward

- **AC-2**: Movement blocked outside NightSurvival
  - Given: Phase = DayService
  - When: Player holds WASD
  - Then: Player position unchanged

- **AC-3**: Gravity applied
  - Given: Player is airborne (above ground)
  - When: No jump input
  - Then: Player falls toward ground each frame

- **AC-4**: base_move_speed is configurable
  - Given: `base_move_speed` set to 3.0 via config
  - When: Player moves for 1 second
  - Then: Distance traveled ≈ 3.0 units (not 5.0)

## Test Evidence

**Story Type**: Logic
**Required evidence**: `tests/unit/player-controller/wasd-movement_test.cs` — unit tests must exist and pass

**Status**: [x] Complete — 19/19 tests passing

- `Assets/_Project/Application/Editor/Tests/WasdMovementTests.cs` (19 tests, AC-1 through AC-4 + edge cases)

---

## Dependencies

- Depends on: Story 001 (Phase-Gated Input) — must be Complete
- Unlocks: Story 003 (Sprint), Story 004 (Cover Detection)
