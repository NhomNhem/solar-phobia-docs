## Next Steps

1. Create stories for all 19 epics: `/create-stories [epic-slug]`
2. Run `/gate-check pre-production` when Foundation + Core epics are complete

---

## Usage

Run `/create-stories [epic-slug]` for each epic to break it into implementable stories.

Example:
```
/create-stories phase-state-machine
/create-stories soul-data-repository
/create-stories player-controller
```
