## Overview

Health/Stamina & Damage Rules defines the unified survival resource system that merges traditional "health" and "stamina" into a single mechanic called **Spirit Ward** (Nước Mắm Cốt). This system tracks the player's humanity and survival time during the night phase, acting as both the timer and the health bar.

**Theme**: "Time pressure and vulnerability" — Every second counts, and every choice has a time cost. The player never feels safe because the timer is always ticking. When Ward drops to critical levels (≤25%), the screen should feel terrifying: chromatic aberration, audio distortion, and the sense that death is imminent.

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Stories for this epic will be marked Blocked until ADR-0005 is created. Run `/architecture_decision` to create the ADR, then proceed.

## Definition of Done

This epic is complete when:
- All stories are implemented, reviewed, and closed via `/story-done`
- All acceptance criteria from `design/gdd/health-stamina-damage-rules.md` are verified
- All Logic and Integration stories have passing test files in `tests/`
- All Visual/Feel and UI stories have evidence docs with sign-off in `production/qa/evidence/`

## Next Step

1. Run `/architecture_decision` to create ADR-0005 (Ward Timer Implementation)
2. Then run `/create-stories ward-timer` to break this epic into implementable stories
