## Overview

Physical Crowding & Push controls the spatial dynamics between Tú and the 3 NPCs (souls) during Day Phase. As the shadow shrinks, space becomes insufficient for all 4 characters, creating physical挤压 (crowding) that forces the player to make difficult positional decisions. The Push mechanic at phase end forces one soul out of the safe zone, writing the `sacrificed_ghost_id`.

**Theme**: "Claustrophobic pressure" — The shadow walls closing in, souls pressed against each other, no room to breathe. The Push mechanic should feel guilt-inducing—forcibly shoving someone out, screen shake, audio impact, the soul burning with a scream.
