## Overview

Shrine Objective & Win/Lose Rules defines the conditions that end the night survival phase—specifically, what constitutes a "win" (reaching the EndShrine) and a "lose" (Ward Timer reaching zero). The system owns the win/lose detection logic, the shrine arrival event flow, and the failure/death sequence.

**Theme**: "Desperate hope" — Each step closer to the shrine is a step away from the whale's jaws. Reaching the shrine should bring overwhelming relief and salvation—the nightmare ends, the whale won't get you, your choices mattered.
