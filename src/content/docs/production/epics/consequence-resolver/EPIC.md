## Overview

Consequence Resolver is the moral arithmetic of Solar Phobia's night phase—it reads the abandoned soul from Day Service's selection payload and translates that choice into a physical curse that hunts the player. The system owns the curse mapping logic, the NightOutcomeState write, and the deterministic assignment that ensures "the person you left behind becomes your nightmare."

**Theme**: "This is my fault" — The curse that hunts them at night is a direct manifestation of the person they abandoned. There's no randomness here; the water trap, blood net, or collapsing platform exists *because* you left that specific soul behind. The fantasy is ownership of horror.
