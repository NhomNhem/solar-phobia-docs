## Overview

Day Service & Selection is the moral core of Solar Phobia's day phase—the moment where the player must choose which 2 of 3 souls to save and which one to abandon to the sun. The system owns the selection UI, validation logic, and confirmation flow that locks the player's choice before night begins.

**Theme**: "Moral weight and visceral discomfort" — The day phase isn't about "completing tasks"—it's about choosing who lives and who burns. The moment of abandonment—physically shoving a soul out of the shade—should feel genuinely uncomfortable, like becoming the monster.
