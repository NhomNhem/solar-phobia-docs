## Overview

Tactile Rituals are the three minigames (diêm, rót, vay) that the player performs during Day Phase to earn Hương Hỏa (Spirit Essence). Each ritual is a physical interaction that feels grounded in Vietnamese cultural tradition—striking matches, pouring tea, fanning coals. Success earns resources; failure incurs penalties.

**Theme**: "Deliberate craftsmanship" — Each action requires attention and physical timing, not just clicking. The rituals should feel intimate and ritualistic—like actually performing the traditions. The minigames create the "tactile discomfort" of day phase before the physical panic of night.
