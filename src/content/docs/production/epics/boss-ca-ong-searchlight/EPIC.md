## Overview

Boss Cá Ông (Whale) Searchlight is the persistent threat during Night Phase—a massive whale skeleton in the background that sweeps a searchlight cone across the playable area. If the player is exposed (not in valid cover) during a sweep, they receive a strike warning, then a -30s Ward penalty. This creates constant tension and forces tactical movement.

**Theme**: "Relentless pursuit" — The whale is always there, always watching, always sweeping. The searchlight should feel oppressive—a green cone of death that forces hiding like prey. Successful covers should feel narrow survival.
