## 1. Character Tổng quan

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Minh — "Elder Brother/Big Brother" |
| **Role** | One of three souls player phải choose to save/abandon |
| **Personality** | Stubborn, practical, slow to trust — the one who feels left behind |
| **Visual Archetype** | Stippled Impasto — dense, textured, heavy pigment stacked |

### Minh's Story
Minh was a fisherman who refused to leave his catch behind. He tried to save his nets and boat from the rising tide while others fled. His form is the heaviest/roughest of the three — he died clinging to material things. He's the "awkward choice" — not the obvious pick, which makes abandoning him feel even worse.

---

## 2. Appearance — Base State (ASSET-044)

### Physical Form
| Element | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Silhouette** | Squat, compact, slightly hunched — like a heavy rock |
| **Form** | Heavy pigment stacked — built-up texture like impasto |
| **Presence** | Rough, heavy, physically present — you feel his weight |
| **Height** | Shorter than player (~1.5m), stocky build |

### Head & Face
- No facial features — just dense texture where a face would be
- Heavy, unyielding expression — tight-lipped, jaw set
- Hair: Messy, unkempt (was too focused on work to care)

### Clothing
| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Top** | Rough work shirt, patched — Ochre Gold (#CC7722) |
| **Pants** | Durable trousers, patched multiple times |
| **Feet** | Bare — fisherman's calloused feet |

### Color Palette
| Element | Color Name | Hex Code |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Primary Pigment** | Ochre Gold | `#CC7722` |
| **Shadow** | Raw Umber | `#826644` |
| **Highlight** | Naples Yellow | `#FADA5E` |
| **Outline** | Dark Brown | `#3D2914` |
| **Skin** | Weathered Brown | `#8B6914` |

### Texture & Technique
- Visible granulation — paper texture showing through pigment
- Heavy, built-up impasto — thick paint application
- Rough, physical presence — not smooth or refined
- Stippled/dotted texture — like sand stuck in paint

---

## 3. Appearance — Saved State (ASSET-049)

When Minh is saved, his stubbornness is rewarded — he becomes solid and secure.

### Changes from Base
| Change | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Brightness** | Colors warm further — Ochre Gold → Deep Golden |
| **Outline** | Solid, unbroken — no cracks or gaps |
| **Form** | More compact, even denser — feels "locked in" |
| **Posture** | Slightly less hunched, more grounded |

### What Stays the Same
- Still the "stippled impasto" — dense, heavy, textured
- Still the roughest/heaviest of the three
- Still physically present — not vaporous or elegant

---

## 4. Appearance — Abandoned State (ASSET-050)

When Minh is abandoned, his form crumbles — the weight he carried becomes too much.

### Changes from Base
| Change | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Form** | Impasto crusts crack — heavy paint breaking apart |
| **Color** | Desaturates to ashen brown-gray |
| **Shape** | Gaps appear showing bare paper through |
| **Expression** | Crumbling, falling apart |

### Visual Metaphor
Minh was heavy, stubborn, clung to things. When abandoned, the weight he carried crushes him. He doesn't dissolve like Linh or fracture like Van — he *crumbles*, heavy paint flaking off to reveal the bare canvas underneath.
