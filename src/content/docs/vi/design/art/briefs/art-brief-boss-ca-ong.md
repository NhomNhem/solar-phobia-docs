## ASSET-020 (Day), ASSET-021 (Night), ASSET-027 (Eyes)

**Project**: Solar Phobia: Nắng Gắt  
**System**: Đèn quét boss Cá Ông  
**Asset ID**: ASSET-020, ASSET-021, ASSET-027  
**Style**: 2D Hand-painted Watercolour

---

## 1. Entity Tổng quan

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Cá Ông — "Grandfather Whale" |
| **Role** | Background boss entity — persistent threat during Phase ban đêm |
| **Philosophy** | Not a character, a stain that keeps growing |
| **Lore** | The whale carcass Tú failed to bury — now consumes him in the Bardo |

### Cá Ông's Role
Cá Ông is the judgment — the consequence of Tú's cowardice. He's always present, always watching, always sweeping his searchlight. The player never fights him directly; they survive his pursuit. He's the shadow that hangs over the entire game.

## 2. Appearance — Day State (ASSET-020)

### Silhouette
| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Form** | Massive whale skeleton — clearly readable but never fully visible |
| **Edges** | Soft, feathered — wet-on-wet watercolor wash effect |
| **Scale** | Background layer — hints at enormous size through fragments |
| **Behavior** | "A stain that keeps growing" — bleeds at edges, never contained |

### Color Palette
| Element | Color Name | Hex Code |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Primary** | Bruised Indigo | `#6B5B7A` |
| **Secondary** | Dusty Violet | `#8B7B9B` |
| **Shadow** | Deep Purple | `#4A3B5C` |
| **Edge Bleed** | Faded Lavender | `#B8A8C8` |

### Visual Technique
- Wet-on-wet wash — edges spread and feather like paint in water
- Partial visibility — you see parts, glimpses, not the whole
- Like looking through murky water — shapes shift and distort
- Never a complete form — always more suggested than shown

---

## 3. Appearance — Night State (ASSET-021)

### Silhouette
| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Form** | Same whale skeleton, now evaporating |
| **Edges** | Lifting off, burning away — gaps and transparency |
| **Scale** | Feels larger, more oppressive in the dark |
| **Behavior** | The whale is consuming the world — edges consume instead of bleed |

### Changes from Day
| Change | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Edges** | No longer soft — now sharp, lifting, evaporating |
| **Gaps** | Bare paper shows through — fire burned through |
| **Color** | Darker, more oppressive — nearly consumes the sky |
| **Presence** | Feels closer, more threatening |

### Color Palette
| Element | Color Name | Hex Code |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Primary** | Deep Charcoal | `#1A1418` |
| **Secondary** | Burnt Umber | `#2D1F1F` |
| **Gaps** | Canvas Cream (bare paper) | `#F5F0E6` |
| **Edge Glow** | Ember Orange (faint) | `#D4652A` |

### Visual Technique
- Burned-through effect — paint lifting off to reveal bare canvas
- Oppressive presence — the whale looms larger in darkness
- Evaporating edges — shapes lose cohesion, dissolve into gaps
- Fire damage aesthetic — this is what "survived a fire" looks like

---

## 4. Appearance — Eyes (ASSET-027)

### Eyes
| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Form** | Two simple dark spots — Charcoal Black (#1A1418) |
| **Detail** | No whites, no pupils — just absence |
| **Expression** | Watching, but not "seeing" as humans do |
| **Scale** | Tiny relative to skeleton, but always visible |

### Philosophy
The whale doesn't look at you — it *watches*. There's no emotion in those eyes, only presence. They mark where it is, what it's tracking, but there's no recognition, no malice, only the blank void of judgment.

## 5. Searchlight Cone (Visual)

### The Sweep
| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Color** | Green searchlight — per GDD (NOT blue) |
| **Shape** | Cone sweeping across the screen |
| **Effect** | Like a spotlight through murky water |
| **VFX** | Particle mist/fog in the beam |

### Searchlight States
| State | Visual |
|-------|--------|
| **Idle/Sweep** | Slow green cone sweep — oppressive, methodical |
| **Telegraph** | Cone brightens, color shifts — warning |
| **Strike** | Bone/rock projectile arcs toward player |
| **Cooldown** | Broken/fragmented whale icon — bruised indigo |
