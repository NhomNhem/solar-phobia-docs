## 1. Character Tổng quan

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Linh — "Spirit/Shadow" |
| **Role** | One of three souls player phải choose to save/abandon |
| **Personality** | Ethereal, fragile, barely present — like mist on water |
| **Visual Archetype** | Watercolor wash — soft, flowing, permeable edges |

### Linh's Story
A young soul, recently deceased. He was a fisherman who tried to save others but drowned himself. His essence is scattered — he can't quite hold his form together. He's the "easiest to lose" because he seems to already be fading.

---

## 2. Appearance — Base State (ASSET-042)

### Physical Form
| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Silhouette** | Rounded, indistinct, almost blob-like but with human proportions |
| **Form** | Wavering edges — like wet paint spreading beyond its boundary |
| **Presence** | Translucent — you can almost see through him |
| **Height** | Slightly shorter than player (~1.6m) |

### Head & Face
- No distinct features — just a lighter wash where a face would be
- Eyes: Two small darker spots, barely visible, like wet ink
- Hair: Short, matted, stuck to head (drowned)

### Clothing
| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Top** | Simple tattered shirt, barely visible — matching the water around him |
| **Pants** | Loose, soaked-through — looks like it's still wet |
| **Feet** | Bare, slightly submerged appearance (optional water ripples) |

### Color Palette
| Element | Color Name | Hex Code |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Primary Wash** | Bruised Indigo | `#5D5B8C` |
| **Shadow** | Deep Violet | `#3D3B6B` |
| **Highlight** | Pale Lavender | `#9B9BC4` |
| **Outline** | None — edges bleed into background |
| **Skin** | Gray-white | `#E8E4DC` with blue undertone |

### Texture & Technique
- Visible wet-on-wet blending — edges are uncertain
- Paper grain showing through pigment (heavy transparency)
- Brush direction: circular, swirling — no hard lines
- "Scattered" effect — small detached pigment spots around form

---

## 3. Appearance — Saved State (ASSET-045)

When Linh is saved, he becomes more present — more real.

### Changes from Base
| Change | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Opacity** | More solid — 70% → 90% opacity |
| **Outline** | Warm rim appears — subtle gold edge (#DAA520) |
| **Color** | Warms slightly — Bruised Indigo → Soft Blue |
| **Form** | More coherent — fewer scattered edges |
| **Expression** | Shoulders back slightly, more upright |

### What Stays the Same
- Still the "wash" archetype — soft, flowing
- Still translucent (not fully opaque)
- Still vulnerable-looking but no longer fading

---

## 4. Appearance — Abandoned State (ASSET-046)

When Linh is abandoned, he begins to erase.

### Changes from Base
| Change | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Opacity** | Fades further — 70% → 40% |
| **Color** | Desaturates toward Canvas Cream (#F5F0E6) |
| **Form** | Lifting off the paper — edges detach entirely |
| **Scattered** | More pigment spots floating away — dissolving |
| **Expression** | Collapsed, barely visible |

### Visual Metaphor
Linh was barely there to begin with. Abandoning him is like letting go of water — there's nothing to hold onto.
