## ASSET-020 — Whale Skeleton Silhouette (Day)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Category | Environment / Boss |
| Dimensions | 512×256px (scaled) |
| Format | PNG with transparency |
| Naming | `whale_skeleton_day.png` |

**Visual Description**:  
A massive whale skeleton silhouette in Bruised Indigo — the background presence. Soft feathered edges like a wet-on-wet watercolour wash. The shape bleeds at the edges, never fully contained. You see parts of it — glimpses through water — not the full form.

**Art Bible Anchors**:
- §5 Character: Whale is "a stain that keeps growing" — not a shape, a presence
- §4 Color: Bruised Indigo = tipping point, between trạng thái

**Generation Prompt**:  
"Massive whale skeleton silhouette, watercolour wet-on-wet wash effect, bruised indigo blue-violet color, soft bleeding edges, partial form visible not fully contained, background layer, game asset"

## ASSET-021 — Whale Skeleton Silhouette (Night)

|-------|-------|
| Category | Environment / Boss |
| Dimensions | 512×256px |
| Format | PNG with transparency |
| Naming | `whale_skeleton_night.png` |

**Visual Description**:  
The same silhouette but now edges evaporate/lift off — the whale is consuming the world. Gaps and transparency where fire has burned through. The form becomes more oppressive as the night progresses.

**Art Bible Anchors**:
- §2 Mood: "Primal terror" — whale as consuming force
- §3 Shape: Night = fractured, exposed skeleton

**Generation Prompt**:  
"Whale skeleton silhouette at night, evaporating edges, burned through gaps showing bare paper, more oppressive form, watercolour damage effect, game background"

## ASSET-022 — Searchlight Cone (Sweep)

| Category | VFX / Hazard |
| Dimensions | 256×512px (cone shape) |
| Format | PNG with transparency |
| Naming | `searchlight_cone.png` |

**Visual Description**:  
A cone shape in bright green/cyan (unique — not from palette, represents artificial light). The edges are harsh — a searchlight is mechanical, not organic. Slight glow/bloom effect. The light source is offshore, casting across the play area.

**Art Bible Anchors**:
- §2 Mood: "The only light comes from the burning horizon" — but this is cold artificial light, not fire
- Contrast: Searchlight = cold, fire = warm

**Generation Prompt**:  
"Searchlight cone effect, bright cyan-green color, harsh mechanical edges not organic, glow/bloom effect, transparent background, game hazard VFX"

**Visual Description**:  
Ground shimmer effect — like heat distortion but cold. Diamond-shaped warning markers (per colorblind rules) that pulse. The warning appears 1.5s before strike.

**Art Bible Anchors**:

**Art Bible Anchors**:
- §4 Color: Ember Orange = đang hoạt động danger, immediate threat

**Generation Prompt**:  
"Strike impact effect, red flash with ember orange burst, screen shake visual, hard impact, critical danger, game VFX"

Fallen rock that becomes new cover after strike. Angular, geometric — fire-created geometry. Charcoal Black with ember edges still glowing. Becomes a safe spot in subsequent sweeps.

**Visual Description**:  
Two simple dark spots — Charcoal Black, no whites, no pupils. Just absence. The whale watches but doesn't see as humans do.
