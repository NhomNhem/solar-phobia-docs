## Knowledge Gap Analysis

Unity 6 is a major release beyond the LLM's training data. Key areas requiring verification:

- **VContainer** — New DI package, not in training data
- **R3** — New reactive system, not in training data
- **UI Toolkit** — Significant changes from uGUI
- **Entities/DOTS** — Major API changes
- **Scriptable Render Pipeline** — New features and defaults

## Usage

Before making architectural decisions that touch HIGH RISK areas:
1. Check `breaking-changes.md` for migration issues
2. Check `deprecated-apis.md` for APIs to avoid
3. Check `current-best-practices.md` for recommended patterns
4. Use WebSearch to verify uncertain APIs against official Unity docs
