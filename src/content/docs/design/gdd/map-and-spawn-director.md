## Overview

Map & Spawn Director controls night-phase spatial pressure in the Act 1 vertical slice. It owns route layout, fog-limited visibility, grave mound placement, shrine endpoints, and boss searchlight strike targeting windows. The player experiences this as a desperate traversal from Am Tho Bai Thuyen to the next safe shrine through a beach lane where cover, cursed pickups, and scanning threat must be read in real time.

## Player Fantasy

The player should feel hunted, exposed, and morally cornered. The map is not an arena to dominate; it is a haunted corridor where every detour for Bone Relics (`Ngoc Cot`) trades safety for guilt and time loss.

## Detailed Design

### Core Rules

**Pre-Night Validation Order**: The following sequence MUST occur before transitioning to NightSurvival:
   a. Map Director validates spawn bundle (route viability, cover placement, hazard zones)
   b. If spawn validation FAILS, return error to Game State Machine → transition to FatalError
   c. Only AFTER spawn validation passes does Consequence Resolver write NightOutcomeState
   d. This prevents locked NPC Model state with invalid night setup

1. Night map is a single horizontal lane between `StartShrine` and `EndShrine`.
2. Global fog limits forward visibility; reveal radius is player-centered.
3. Grave mounds are the primary tactical objects:
   - `SafeMound` (`MoThuong`): reliable cover.
   - `CursedMound` (`MoOan`): cover + Bone Relic pickup trigger.
   - `FalseSafeMound`: conditional trap cover spawned by consequence rules.
4. Boss remains in offshore background and projects periodic horizontal searchlight sweeps.
5. If player is exposed when sweep confirms line-of-sight, strike telegraph starts; unresolved exposure causes hit.
6. Cover validity requires player collider fully inside mound cover volume.
7. Bone Relic pickup from CursedMound applies hallucination package and Time Drain multiplier to Ward Timer.
8. Spawn set must always include at least one valid route from start to end with optional risk detours.
9. Map resets deterministically per seed on new run.
10. **Unified Resource Rule**: Night Phase has no separate HP; all lethal pressure is represented through Ward Timer depletion.
11. Strike hit applies timer loss and terrain disruption: default `StrikeTimePenaltySec = 30` and nearest active Mound is destroyed, creating debris that becomes a NEW cover volume for subsequent sweeps.
12. FalseSafeMound must present a readable warning tell before failure (`TellDurationSec`), never instant-kill by surprise.

### States and Transitions

| State | Entry Condition | Exit Condition | Behavior |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| NightMapInit | Night phase starts | Spawn validation passes | Build lane, place objects, set fog |
| PatrolSweep | Init complete | Sweep interval elapsed | Boss searchlight scans lane |
| StrikeTelegraph | Player exposed during sweep | Telegraph timer ends | Warn target zone |
| StrikeResolve | Telegraph complete | Strike processed | Apply timer penalty, knockback, and cover break if still exposed |
| ShrineSafe | Player enters end shrine | Night resolve | Disable threats, hand off to resolve |

### Interactions with Other Systems

- **Game State / Phase State Machine -> Map Director**: start/stop lifecycle events, phase lock.
- **NPC/Soul Data Model -> Map Director**: abandoned soul + consequence intensity to bias Mo Oan and disruption placement.
- **Boss Chase AI <-> Map Director**: sweep pattern ownership split (Map owns lane geometry; Boss AI owns timing profile).
- **Solar Residue Hazard <-> Map Director**: hazard zones bound to lane segments and visibility constraints.
- **Health/Stamina & Damage Rules <-> Map Director**: map emits strike/relic/time-drain events; survivability rules return viability constraints and penalty caps.
- **Resource Effects <- Map Director**: Bone Relic pickup events trigger Time Drain modifier.
- **Player Controller <- Map Director**: receives cover zone and strike warning overlap events.
- **Consequence Resolver -> Map Director**: can flag FalseSafeMound spawns (e.g., Linh-abandoned route profile).

## Formulas

### Sweep Exposure Check

```
is_exposed = in_sweep_cone AND (not in_valid_cover)
```

| Variable | Type | Range | Source | Description |
|----------|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| in_sweep_cone | bool | {0,1} | runtime geometry | Player intersecting active sweep band |
| in_valid_cover | bool | {0,1} | cover system | True only when fully covered |

**Expected output range**: boolean  
**Edge case**: if cover collider missing, treat as `in_valid_cover = 0`.

### Time Drain Under Bone Relic

```
effective_ward_drain = base_drain_rate * (1 + (bones_carried * hallucination_multiplier))
```

| Variable | Type | Range | Source | Description |
|----------|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| base_drain_rate | float/sec | 0.1-5.0 | config | Default protection decay |
| bones_carried | int | 0-3 | runtime inventory | Bone Relics carried in current run |
| hallucination_multiplier | float | 1.0-3.0 | config | Extra decay per bone relic (1 bone = 2×, 2 bones = 3×) |

**Expected output range**: 0.1-20.0/sec  
**Edge case**: clamp to project max safe drain cap.

### Strike Penalty

```
ward_time_after_hit = max(0, ward_time_before_hit - strike_time_penalty_sec)
```

| Variable | Type | Range | Source | Description |
|----------|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| ward_time_before_hit | float sec | 0-600 | runtime | Current Ward Timer before impact |
| strike_time_penalty_sec | float sec | 5-60 | config | Timer chunk removed by strike hit |

**Expected output range**: 0-600 sec  
**Edge case**: if result is 0, trigger immediate fail resolution.

### Route Viability Check (Fairness Guard)

```
is_route_viable = ward_time_remaining > (distance_to_goal / effective_move_speed) + safety_buffer_sec
```

| Variable | Type | Range | Source | Description |
|----------|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| ward_time_remaining | float sec | 0-600 | runtime | Current timer |
| distance_to_goal | float | >0 | runtime | Remaining route distance |
| effective_move_speed | float | >0 | runtime | Speed after active penalties |
| safety_buffer_sec | float sec | 5-30 | config | Fairness margin for normal play |

**Expected output range**: boolean  
**Edge case**: if false immediately after first relic pickup, reduce active TimeDrain one tier for this run segment.

### Cover Density Validation

```
cover_density = mo_thuong_count / lane_length
```

| Variable | Type | Range | Source | Description |
|----------|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| mo_thuong_count | int | 0-50 | spawn pass | Number of regular cover mounds |
| lane_length | float | >0 | map data | Traversable night lane length |

**Expected output range**: design target 0.02-0.08 per unit length  
**Edge case**: if below minimum threshold, regenerate placement once.

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Expected Behavior | Rationale |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| No valid cover spawned in opening segment | Force-spawn one SafeMound near start | Prevent unavoidable opening hit |
| CursedMound blocks only route to shrine | Regenerate as side detour or convert to SafeMound | Keep risk optional, not mandatory |
| Sweep and strike telegraph overlap shrine safe zone | Suppress strike in safe zone | Preserve rule clarity |
| Player picks Bone Relic during active strike telegraph | Apply Time Drain immediately, do not cancel strike | Consistent risk timing |
| Fog occludes mandatory telegraph VFX | Boost local telegraph contrast in fog | Ensure fair readability |
| Seed generates dead-end route | Fail validation and rebuild layout | Guarantee completion path |
| Player hides behind FalseSafeMound | Mound emits warning tell (audio crack + visual fissure) for `TellDurationSec`, then collapses; player can still dodge | Keeps fear fair/readable |

## Dependencies

| System | Direction | Nature of Dependency |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| Game State / Phase State Machine | This depends on it | **Hard**: lifecycle and phase authority |
| NPC/Soul Data Model | This depends on it | **Hard**: consequence-informed spawn bias |
| Boss Chase AI | Bidirectional | **Hard**: synchronized sweep/strike behavior |
| Solar Residue Hazard | Bidirectional | **Hard**: hazard placement contracts |
| Health/Stamina & Damage Rules | Bidirectional | **Hard**: strike/relic penalties consume ward timer; map generation respects viability/fairness constraints |
| Resource Effects | This system feeds it | **Soft**: emits Bone Relic pickup + Time Drain events |
| Player Controller | This system feeds it | **Hard**: cover/strike overlap signals |

## Interface Ownership

- **Map & Spawn Director owns**: `base_drain_rate` (default protection decay, configurable 0.1-5.0), `hallucination_multiplier` (extra decay per bone relic, configurable 1.0-3.0), `StrikeTimePenaltySec` (timer penalty per strike, default 30s, range 5-60).
- **Health/Stamina & Damage Rules** references these values but does not own them.
- **Game State / Phase State Machine** references `StrikeTimePenaltySec` but does not own it.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Start-to-end shrine route always exists in generated lane.
- [ ] Sweep exposure correctly ignores players fully inside valid cover.
- [ ] Strike never applies timer penalty inside shrine safe zone.
- [ ] CursedMound pickup always applies hallucination package and Time Drain.
- [ ] At least one optional Bone Relic detour exists in baseline slice seed.
- [ ] Night traversal remains readable under target fog settings without jump-scare reliance.
- [ ] FalseSafeMound always provides warning tell before collapse.
- [ ] First Bone Relic pickup is not auto-fail under baseline route viability check.

## Open Questions

| Question | Owner | Deadline | Resolution |
|----------|-------|----------|------------|
| Should Mo Oan placement follow fixed authored points or weighted procedural sets? | Level Designer | Before second playtest wave | Open |
| Should sweep pattern have one fake-out cycle for tension variation? | Game Designer | Before boss polish pass | Open |
| Should Bone Relics be droppable mid-run to remove Time Drain? | Systems Designer | Before economy/system lock | Open |
