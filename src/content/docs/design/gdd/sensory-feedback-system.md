## Overview

Sensory Feedback System provides diegetic, non-HUD information to the player about their survival state. Instead of watching a progress bar, the player feels danger approaching through progressive visual and audio degradation. The system maps Ward Timer thresholds to sensory tiers that alter the player's perception without explicit numbers. Without this system, the player relies on HUD elements, breaking immersion and the "readable survival pressure" pillar.

## Player Fantasy

The player should feel **unconscious awareness**—knowing they're in danger without seeing numbers. The degradation should create **dread escalation**—each tier feels worse than the last, building to "Hopeless Hope" where the player knows death is coming but fights anyway.

## Detailed Design

### Core Rules

1. **Tier Mapping**: Ward Timer percentage maps to 5 sensory tiers:
   - Tier 1 (>75%): Stable - no degradation
   - Tier 2 (≤75%): Creeping Dread - vignette appears
   - Tier 3 (≤50%): Heavy Burden - audio changes, dash cooldown
   - Tier 4 (≤25%): Panic - chromatic aberration, whispering
   - Tier 5 (≤10s): Death Spiral - tunnel vision, tinnitus

2. **Tier Transitions**: Smooth interpolation between tiers, not abrupt switches.
3. **Visual Degradation**: Vignette → Lowpass audio → Chromatic aberration → Tunnel vision (progressive)
4. **Audio Degradation**: Normal → Lowpass filter → Heavy breathing → Whispering → Tinnitus (progressive)
5. **Duration Cap**: Tier 4 (Panic) capped at 30 seconds max to prevent feedback loop.

### States and Transitions

| State | Entry Condition | Exit Condition | Behavior |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| Tier1_Stable | Ward > 75% | Ward ≤ 75% | No effects |
| Tier2_CreepingDread | Ward ≤ 75% | Ward ≤ 50% | Vignette α=0.3, lowpass audio |
| Tier3_HeavyBurden | Ward ≤ 50% | Ward ≤ 25% | Breathing audio, dash +0.1s cooldown |
| Tier4_Panic | Ward ≤ 25% | Ward ≤ 10s or 30s cap | Chromatic aberration, whispers |
| Tier5_DeathSpiral | Ward ≤ 10s | Ward = 0 | Tunnel vision 80%, tinnitus |

### Interactions with Other Systems

- **Health/Stamina & Damage Rules -> Sensory Feedback**: Sends Ward value updates. System computes tier.
- **Player Controller <- Sensory Feedback**: Receives dash cooldown penalty during Tier 3.
- **Audio State Director <- Sensory Feedback**: Receives tier changes for audio mix.
- **Night Survival Run -> Sensory Feedback**: Ward values during night phase.

## Formulas

### Tier Threshold Check
```
current_tier = 
  if ward_pct > 75: TIER_1
  elif ward_pct > 50: TIER_2
  elif ward_pct > 25: TIER_3
  elif ward_sec_remaining > 10: TIER_4
  else: TIER_5
```

### Vignette Alpha (Tier 2-4)
```
vignette_alpha = lerp(0, 0.6, (tier - 2) / 3)
```

### Audio Lowpass Frequency (Tier 2-5)
```
lowpass_freq = lerp(20000, 500, (tier - 2) / 3)
```

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Expected Behavior | Rationale |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Ward jumps from 80% to 20% (boss strike) | Jump to Tier 4 immediately | Instant feedback for major events |
| Ward recovers (unlikely but possible) | Reverse tier progression | Symmetry in system |
| Multiple rapid tier changes | Queue transitions, smooth interpolation | Prevent visual jarring |
| Player in menu during tier change | Changes apply but player doesn't see | Continue state tracking |

## Dependencies

| System | Direction | Nature of Dependency |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| Health/Stamina & Damage Rules | This depends on it | **Hard**: Ward value source |
| Player Controller | This depends on it | **Soft**: dash cooldown modifier |
| Audio State Director | This depends on it | **Hard**: audio tier changes |
| Night Survival Run | This depends on it | **Hard**: night phase is when active |

## Tuning Knobs

| Parameter | Current Value | Safe Range | Effect of Increase | Effect of Decrease |
|-----------|---------------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `tier2_threshold_pct` | 75 | 70-80 | Earlier creeping dread | Later onset |
| `tier3_threshold_pct` | 50 | 45-55 | Earlier heavy burden | Later onset |
| `tier4_threshold_pct` | 25 | 20-30 | Earlier panic | Later onset |
| `tier5_threshold_sec` | 10 | 5-15 | Earlier death spiral | Later onset |
| `tier4_max_duration_sec` | 30 | 20-45 | Longer panic state | Shorter panic |
| `max_vignette_alpha` | 0.6 | 0.4-0.8 | Darker vignette | Lighter vignette |

## Visual/Audio Requirements

| Tier | Visual | Audio |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 (Stable) | Normal image | Normal ambient |
| 2 (Creeping) | Vignette α=0.3 | Lowpass filter |
| 3 (Heavy) | + breathing overlay | Heavy breathing sounds |
| 4 (Panic) | Chromatic aberration | Whispering voices |
| 5 (Death) | Tunnel vision 80% | Tinnitus squeal |

## UI Requirements

None - this is HUD-less design. All feedback is diegetic.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Ward values correctly map to tiers
- [ ] Vignette appears at Tier 2
- [ ] Audio lowpass at Tier 2
- [ ] Dash cooldown +0.1s at Tier 3
- [ ] Chromatic aberration at Tier 4
- [ ] Tier 4 caps at 30 seconds max
- [ ] Tunnel vision + tinnitus at Tier 5
