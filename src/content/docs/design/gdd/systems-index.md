## Overview

Solar Phobia's mechanical scope centers on a consequence-driven day/night loop: choose who to save in a constrained daytime decision phase, then survive the night while facing direct gameplay consequences from the person left behind. The minimum system map prioritizes loop orchestration, consequence transformation, and readable survival pressure over content breadth. This index decomposes those needs into implementable systems, dependencies, and design order for the vertical slice.

## Categories

| Category | Description | Typical Systems |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Core** | Foundation systems everything depends on | Loop state machine, player controller, objective/win-lose logic, ward timer, camera transition |
| **Gameplay** | The systems that make the game fun | Day selection, consequences, curses, hazards, chase pressure, shadow management, tactile rituals, physical crowding |
| **Economy** | Resource creation and consumption | Tea/incense/offering effects and conversion, Hương Hỏa points |
| **Persistence** | Save state and continuity | Run reset and deterministic restart |
| **UI** | Player-facing information displays | Choice feedback, danger readability, objective cues, sensory feedback |
| **Audio** | Sound and music systems | Day/night mix state, threat escalation cues |
| **Narrative** | Story and identity state delivery | NPC/soul identity and abandonment state |

## Priority Tiers

| Tier | Definition | Target Milestone | Design Urgency |
|------|------------|------------------|----------------|
| **MVP** | Required for the core loop to function. Without these, you can't test "is this fun?" | First playable prototype | Design FIRST |
| **Vertical Slice** | Required for one complete, polished area. Demonstrates the full experience. | Vertical slice / demo | Design SECOND |
| **Alpha** | All features present in rough form. Complete mechanical scope, placeholder content OK. | Alpha milestone | Design THIRD |
| **Full Vision** | Polish, edge cases, nice-to-haves, and content-complete features. | Beta / Release | Design as needed |

## High-Risk Systems

| System | Risk Type | Risk Description | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|------------------|------------|
| Consequence Resolver | Design | If curse mapping is unclear, choices feel arbitrary instead of meaningful. | Prototype 3 fixed curse mappings early and run fast playtests for readability. |
| Night Survival Run | Scope | Combines hazards, chase, curses, and objective timing; can over-expand quickly. | Hard-lock one map and one completion condition for slice; defer variants. |
| Boss Cá Ông Searchlight | Technical | Poor pacing/tuning can make night either trivial or unfair. | Start with simple pursuit states and tune via fixed benchmark runs. |
| Ward Timer / Nước Mắm Cốt | Design | HUD-less design requires clear sensory feedback; unclear feedback = unfair deaths. | Test sensory feedback thresholds early with playtests. |
| Curse Effect Modules | Design | Multiple curses interacting can create impossible combinations. | Limit to 1-2 curses active simultaneously for MVP. |

## Next Steps

- [ ] Design MVP-tier systems first (use `/design-system [system-name]`)
- [ ] Run `/design-review` on each completed GDD
- [ ] Run `/gate-check pre-production` when MVP systems are designed
- [ ] Prototype the highest-risk system early (`/prototype [system]`)
