## 1. Sonic Identity

**Core Aesthetic**: Watercolour on paper — organic, textured, intimate. Audio should feel like sound ON the page, not OF the world.

**Emotional Targets**:
- Day: Warm, measured, contemplative — like gentle waves on a quiet shore
- Night: Urgent, desperate, primal — like being hunted by something ancient

## 2. Audio Palette

### Ambient Layers

| Layer | Day | Night | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------|-------|
| **Base** | Ocean waves (gentle) | Ocean waves (urgent) | Always present — represents the sea |
| **Wind** | Light breeze | Strong gusts | Increases with danger |
| **Vocals** | Soft village ambient | Whispers/distant calls | Linh/Van/Minh presence |
| **Threat** | None | Low whale drone | Offshore presence |

### Music Direction

**Day Phase**: 
- Sparse, spacious — single instrument (guitar or similar)
- Feels like memory, reflection
- No rhythm — just atmosphere

**Night Phase**:
- Tension building — low pulse/drone
- Layers add in as danger increases
- Stingers on strike warnings
- Relief stinger on shrine arrival

## 5. Technical Notes

**Memory Budget Estimate**: ~50-80MB for core loop audio
- Music: 20-30MB (adaptive stems)
- SFX: 15-25MB (compressed OGG)
- Ambient: 10-20MB (loops)

**Audio Middleware**: Use Unity Audio or FMOD (not specified in tech stack)

**Adaptive Music**: Layer-based system — add layers based on:
- Ward timer level (tension increases as timer drops)
- Proximity to boss sweep (threat rises during sweep)
- Cover state (quieter when in cover)

## 6. Open Questions

| Question | Owner | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Use Unity Audio or FMOD? | Technical | Depends on project setup |
| Voice acting for NPCs? | Narrative | Linh/Van/Minh — dialogue or just ambient? |
| Music composer? | Audio Director | Need to commission or license |
