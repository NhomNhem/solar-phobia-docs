## 1. Character Overview

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Van — "Crowd/Multitude" |
| **Role** | One of three souls player must choose to save/abandon |
| **Personality** | Bold, confident, reliable — the one you want to save |
| **Visual Archetype** | Ink stroke — sharp, angular, confident, single brushstroke |

### Van's Story
Van was a strong swimmer, a leader in the village. He tried to hold the rope against the whale but was dragged under. His form is the most solid of the three — he died trying to help others. He's the "obvious choice" to save, which makes the moral weight harder.

---

## 2. Appearance — Base State (ASSET-043)

### Physical Form
| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Silhouette** | Geometric, squared shoulders, upright pose |
| **Form** | Single confident brushstroke — like one motion created him |
| **Presence** | Solid, defined — you can't miss him |
| **Height** | Slightly taller than player (~1.9m) |

### Head & Face
- No facial features — just a darker stroke where a face would be
- Strong jaw line suggested by stroke direction
- Hair: Short-cropped, neat (was a leader, took care of himself)

### Clothing
| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Top** | Simple vest/shirt, button-up style — Burnt Sienna (#8B4513) |
| **Pants** | Dark trousers, straight leg |
| **Feet** | Bare — working man's feet, calloused |

### Color Palette
| Element | Color Name | Hex Code |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Primary Stroke** | Burnt Sienna | `#8B4513` |
| **Shadow** | Dark Umber | `#5D3A1A` |
| **Highlight** | Warm Tan | `#CD853F` |
| **Outline** | Near-black ink | `#1A1A1A` |
| **Skin** | Warm brown | `#A0785A` |

### Texture & Technique
- Visible brush direction — horizontal strokes building form
- Strong, confident linework
- No blending/wet effects — crisp application
- Stroke ends are sharp, deliberate

## 3. Appearance — Saved State (ASSET-047)

When Van is saved, his confidence is rewarded.

### Changes from Base
| Change | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Brightness** | Colors intensify — Burnt Sienna → Rich Orange-Sienna |
| **Outline** | Warm gold rim glow appears (#FFD700) |
| **Form** | Even more solid — stroke feels "reinforced" |
| **Posture** | Broader shoulders, more upright |

### What Stays the Same
- Still the "ink stroke" — sharp, confident, geometric
- Still the most solid of the three
- Still reliable-looking

---

## 4. Appearance — Abandoned State (ASSET-048)

When Van is abandoned, his form fractures.

### Changes from Base
| Change | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Form** | Stroke splits into multiple branching lines — like a struck match |
| **Color** | Desaturates to gray-brown |
| **Shape** | Breaking apart — losing coherence |
| **Expression** | Fragmented, disintegrating |

### Visual Metaphor
Van was solid, reliable, unbreakable. But when abandoned, he realizes his strength wasn't enough. He breaks — not dissolves like Linh, but *shatters*.
